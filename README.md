## Luoyou-Campus-Navigation-App-Backend
"Luoyou" is a Android App which was sponsored by Wuhan University, which was expected to tackle with the increasing amount of tourists each year in "Sakula Festifal" season and their difficulties in navigation the campus.
I dealed with the coding of backend of this app. The backend provides route planning and spatial searching result to the frontend by geoJson.
Interfaces of this backend program: spatial query interface, route planning interface (optimizations needed), route mode switch interface (pedestrian, bus, car route), fuzzy query interface (about point of interests).
SpringMVC is used as project structure.</br>
